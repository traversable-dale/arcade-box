# arcade-box
This is the arcade box:

Picture a yellow blanket over some cushions in the corner of a cozy living.
There is a tiny computer monitor in the corner, along with some plants and a lego keyboard.
When you approach the box, the lighting shifts to a dim spotlight- the ambient sounds of the room are pulled in-
they become condensed, swirled, sharp, and quantized- like a classic 8-bit video game you've always wanted to play.

Here you will find the arcade-box repository. Within this repo are a combination of tiny projects:

1. Funky Numbers (td) - keyboard based counting game that uses 1 function keeps a score
2. console-01 (td) - basic container layout for arcade box
3. arcade-box-01 (td) - first attempt at a mario-like platformer with character control and image placement
4. arcade-box-02 (td) - second iteration of good mushrooms as a td-platformer, character select exploration
5. good mushrooms (pygame) - first attempt of a mario-like platformer using pygame (no sprites)
6. good mushrooms-01 (pygame) - mario-style platformer using pygame, sprites, character animations

There are 2 parallel goals with this repo:
1. Become a better programmer, solidify new skills, expand deeper into python
2. art for art's sake, love, 1 + 1 = 2 = 1 + 1
